The stationery brand, [BenjaminPop!](https://www.benjaminpop.com/collections/scratch-offs/products/never-have-i-ever-loved-more-scratch-off-greeting-card), was looking for a fun and unique greeting card that harmonizes with the style of the stationery brand; authentic, engaging, and with (of course) some added POP!

What was created was a bold and playful card inspired by the game "never have I ever" with a loving hidden message under each scratch-off area, along with notepads in the same style.

This card received ["Best New Product"](https://www.instagram.com/p/BUhOWeiheAz/) nomination at the 2017 National Stationery Show in New York.
