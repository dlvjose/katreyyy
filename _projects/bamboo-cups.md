Marriott Vacation Club resorts have a yearly reusable cup for their guests to use. The guests can receive free refills and feel good about purchasing the reusable cups because they were also donating. The annual reusable cup benefits the Childrenâ€™s Miracle Network Hospitals, with a portion of proceeds being donated to their cause.

In the past, the cup designs were insulated plastic tumblers with a resort-specific image wrapping the cup. In 2019, I took a different approach to this design, presenting a creative and eco-friendly concept. The illustrations and theme of the cup are based on regional and local area experiences. We wanted these to be a collectible and commemorative series. For an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution, these cups were produced with bamboo - giving the cup a unique look and feel.
