Marriott Vacation Club resorts have a yearly reusable cup for their guests to use at the resorts. With the reusable cups the guests can receive free refills as well as feel good about purchasing because they were also donating. The annual reusable cup benefits the Childrenâ€™s Miracle Network Hospitals with a portion of proceeds being donated to their cause.

In the past the cup designs were insulated plastic tumblers with a resort specific image wrapping the cup. In 2019, I took a different approach to this design presenting a concept that was an artistic and eco-friendly solution. The illustrations and theme of the cup are based off of regional and local area experiences. We wanted these to be a collectible and commemorative series. For an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution these cups were produces with bamboo - giving the cup a very unique look and feel.
