# Better World
Illustration and Character Design

![Illustration of young girl waving and standing in a forest.](/assets/images/betterworld-illo-main.png)

Animation and design studio, [Park Ave](https://www.parkave.co/), hired me to create illustration deliverables for an upcoming animated story made to inspire.

It's about a young girl that is walking in an empty space but with every step she takes she is creating flowers and plants under her feet. When she finally turns around she sees she has created a beautiful forest.
