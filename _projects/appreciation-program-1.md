The ask was to create an evergreen campaign for Marriott Vacations Worldwide’s Associate Appreciation program campaign to be used globally for the next few years. The concept emphasizes the individual with a celebratory feel. The goal was to create a campaign that was festive, unique, and recognized associates for their contributions while getting them excited about taking part in upcoming celebrations within the company. “You’re unique, and we’re celebrating all you do.”
